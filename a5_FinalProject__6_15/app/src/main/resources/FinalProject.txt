This simulation shows a traffic system where vehicles move through a grid representing a city layout. This grid includes both roads and intersections with traffic lights.

The simulation includes cars represented as blue dots that move freely within the grid but stop when encountering red traffic lights. The gray areas represent regular roads where cars can move freely. The red and green lines indicate traffic lights. When the lights turn red, cars halt. When the lights turn green, cars resume moving again.The control panel includes:

      •	Start Button: Initiates the simulation.
      •	Pause Button: Pauses the simulation.
      •	Reset Button: Resets the simulation along with the speed and timing inputs.
      •	Speed Input Field: Allows users to set the speed of the cars within a range of 1 to 100. If the input is outside this range, a message dialog box will prompt you to enter a valid number.
      •	Set Speed Button: Applies the speed entered in the speed input field.
      •	Timing Input Field: Allows users to set the traffic light timing, determining how quickly the lights change from red to green. The valid range is 1 to 60. Inputs outside this range will trigger a message dialog box to remind you of the correct range.
      •	Set Timing Button: Sets the traffic light timing based on the input provided.
