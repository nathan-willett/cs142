supposedly an issue with this one?

 * Assume that you have a variable called line that will take on the values 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on, and a class 
 * constant named SIZE that takes two values. You are going to formulate expressions in terms of line and SIZE 
 * that will yield different sequences of numbers of characters. The first row is filled in for you as an example. 
 * Fill in the solution boxes below, indicating an expression that will generate each sequence. Your answers must 
 * be in the exact format 'coefficient1 * line + (coefficient2 * SIZE + offset)' in that order to be counted as 
 * correct.
