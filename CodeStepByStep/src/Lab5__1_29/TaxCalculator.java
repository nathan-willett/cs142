/*
 * Write a method named computeTax that accepts a salary as a parameter and that returns the amount of tax you would owe if you make that
 * salary. The tax is based on your tax bracket as found from the first two columns below. Once you know which row to use, start with the "flat
 * amount" and add the "plus %" of the amount over the amount listed in the final column. For example, if your income is $50,000, then you use 
 * the third row of the table and compute the tax as $4,000 plus 25% of the amount over $29,050, which comes to $9,237.50. The total tax on 
 * $27,500 is $3,767.50. For $6,000, the tax is $600. For $120,000, the tax is $28,227. Assume your method is passed a value â‰¥ 0.
